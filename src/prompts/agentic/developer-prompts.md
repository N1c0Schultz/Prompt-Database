# Agentic Developer Prompts

These prompts help developers create autonomous systems, multi-step workflows, and agent-based applications.

## Build Autonomous Workflow System

```
I need to create an autonomous workflow system with the following specifications:

**System purpose:**
[Describe what the autonomous system should accomplish]

**Technical requirements:**
- Platform: [web/desktop/mobile/cloud]
- Programming language: [preferred language]
- Integration needs: [APIs, databases, external services]
- Scalability requirements: [concurrent users, data volume]
- Performance constraints: [response time, throughput]

**Autonomous capabilities needed:**
- [ ] Task scheduling and execution
- [ ] Decision-making based on conditions
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Progress monitoring and reporting
- [ ] Adaptive behavior based on outcomes
- [ ] Multi-step workflow coordination

**Workflow specifications:**
- Input triggers: [what starts the workflow]
- Decision points: [where autonomous choices are made]
- Success criteria: [how to measure completion]
- Failure handling: [what to do when things go wrong]
- Human intervention points: [when to escalate]

**Please provide:**
1. **System architecture** with autonomous components
2. **Core workflow engine** implementation
3. **Decision-making logic** and rule system
4. **Monitoring and logging** infrastructure
5. **Error recovery mechanisms**
6. **Testing strategy** for autonomous behavior
7. **Configuration and tuning** guidance

Include examples of typical workflows and edge case handling.
```

**Use Case**: Building systems that can operate independently
**Output**: Complete autonomous workflow implementation
**Best For**: Process automation, AI agents, self-managing systems

## Multi-Agent Coordination System

```
Design a multi-agent system where different AI agents collaborate to achieve complex goals:

**System overview:**
- Number of agents: [specify how many agents]
- Agent specializations: [what each agent is responsible for]
- Coordination mechanism: [how agents communicate and coordinate]
- Shared resources: [databases, APIs, storage they share]

**Agent specifications:**
For each agent type, specify:
- Primary responsibilities: [main tasks and capabilities]
- Decision authority: [what they can decide independently]
- Communication protocols: [how they interact with other agents]
- Data requirements: [what information they need]

**Coordination requirements:**
- Task distribution: [how work is allocated between agents]
- Conflict resolution: [how to handle competing priorities]
- Progress synchronization: [how agents stay coordinated]
- Failure handling: [what happens when an agent fails]

**Technical implementation:**
- Programming language/framework: [preferred technology]
- Message passing system: [agent communication method]
- State management: [how system state is maintained]
- Monitoring and observability: [how to track agent behavior]

**Please provide:**
1. **Agent architecture** with clear responsibilities
2. **Communication protocols** and message formats
3. **Coordination algorithms** for task distribution
4. **Conflict resolution mechanisms**
5. **Implementation code** for core components
6. **Testing strategies** for multi-agent scenarios
7. **Deployment and scaling** considerations

Focus on robust, scalable agent coordination patterns.
```

**Use Case**: Creating collaborative AI agent systems
**Output**: Multi-agent system architecture and implementation
**Best For**: Complex automation, distributed AI systems, collaborative workflows
