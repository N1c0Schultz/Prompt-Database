# Getting Started with AI Prompt Library

Welcome to the AI Prompt Library! This comprehensive guide will help you understand, use, and contribute to our collection of carefully curated AI prompts.

## üìñ What is This Library?

The AI Prompt Library is a structured collection of prompts designed for different use cases and AI models. Our prompts are organized into:

- **5 Categories**: Creative, Technical, General, Agentic, and Professional
- **3 Types per Category**: System prompts, Developer prompts, and User prompts
- **Tested and Documented**: Each prompt includes usage guidance and compatibility information

## üéØ Understanding Prompt Types

### System Prompts
Configure AI personality and behavior for specific roles.
- **Purpose**: Set up AI assistant persona and capabilities
- **When to use**: At the start of conversations to establish context
- **Example**: Configure AI as a "senior software engineer" or "creative writing assistant"

### Developer Prompts  
Help developers with coding, debugging, and technical tasks.
- **Purpose**: Generate code, solve technical problems, review implementations
- **When to use**: During development workflow and technical problem-solving
- **Example**: "Review this code" or "Implement a feature with specific requirements"

### User Prompts
Assist end-users with various tasks and inquiries.
- **Purpose**: Help with learning, problem-solving, and everyday tasks
- **When to use**: When you need AI assistance for personal or professional tasks
- **Example**: "Explain a complex topic" or "Help me solve a problem"

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Choose Your Category
Navigate to the appropriate category based on your needs:
- `src/prompts/creative/` - Creative writing, art, design
- `src/prompts/technical/` - Programming, debugging, tech docs
- `src/prompts/general/` - Learning, research, everyday tasks
- `src/prompts/agentic/` - Autonomous tasks, planning, decision-making
- `src/prompts/professional/` - Business, workplace, communication

### 2. Select Prompt Type
- **System**: Configure AI behavior (`system-prompts.md`)
- **Developer**: Get coding help (`developer-prompts.md`)  
- **User**: Get general assistance (`user-prompts.md`)

### 3. Copy and Customize
1. Find a relevant prompt in the appropriate file
2. Copy the prompt template
3. Fill in the placeholders with your specific information
4. Use with your preferred AI model

### 4. Test and Iterate
- Start with the base prompt
- Adjust based on results
- Refine for your specific use case

## üí° Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts
- **Be Specific**: Provide clear context and requirements
- **Use Examples**: Include examples when helpful
- **Set Expectations**: Define desired output format and style
- **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results

### Choosing the Right Prompt
- **Match the task**: Use creative prompts for creative tasks, technical for coding
- **Consider complexity**: Use system prompts for complex, ongoing interactions
- **Think about audience**: Developer prompts for technical users, user prompts for general use

### Model Compatibility
- **GPT Models**: Work well with most prompts, especially complex ones
- **Claude**: Excellent for long-form content and detailed analysis
- **Gemini**: Good for general tasks and research-oriented prompts
- **Check Compatibility**: Each prompt lists recommended models

## üîç Finding Prompts

### Browse by Category
```bash
# View all categories
ls src/prompts/

# Browse creative prompts
ls src/prompts/creative/
```

### Search by Keyword
```bash
# Search for specific terms
npm run search "debugging"
npm run search "story writing"
```

### Get Library Statistics
```bash
npm run search -- --stats
```

## üìù Customizing Prompts

Most prompts include placeholders in brackets like `[your input here]`. Replace these with:

1. **Your specific requirements**
2. **Context about your project** 
3. **Desired output format**
4. **Any constraints or preferences**

### Example Customization
**Original prompt:**
```
Help me create a [type of application] using [programming language].
```

**Customized:**
```
Help me create a todo list web application using React and TypeScript.
```
