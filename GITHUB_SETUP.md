# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide will help you create a GitHub repository for your AI Prompt Library and connect it to your local project.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have:

- âœ… Local project setup complete
- âœ… Git repository initialized 
- âœ… All files committed locally
- ðŸ”„ GitHub account (sign up at [github.com](https://github.com) if needed)

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. **Create New Repository**: 
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"
3. **Repository Settings**:
   - **Repository name**: `ai-prompt-library` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `A comprehensive collection of high-quality AI prompts organized by category and use case`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **Important**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "/Users/1c0n/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-ns@nicoschultz.com-folder/Documents/Creative IP/VSCode/Prompt Database"

# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-prompt-library.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files uploaded
3. Check that the README.md displays correctly

## Step 4: Repository Settings (Optional)

Consider configuring these GitHub features:

### Topics/Tags
Add topics to make your repository discoverable:
- Go to your repository page
- Click the gear icon next to "About"
- Add topics: `ai`, `prompts`, `chatgpt`, `claude`, `prompt-engineering`, `ai-tools`

### Branch Protection
For collaboration:
- Go to Settings â†’ Branches
- Add rule for `main` branch
- Enable "Require pull request reviews before merging"

### GitHub Pages (Optional)
To create a website from your repository:
- Go to Settings â†’ Pages
- Source: Deploy from a branch
- Branch: main, folder: / (root)

## Step 5: Share Your Repository

Once uploaded, you can:
- Share the repository URL with others
- Submit to awesome lists (like awesome-chatgpt-prompts)
- Add the repository link to your portfolio/resume
- Contribute to open source prompt collections

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
If you encounter authentication errors:
1. Use GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`
2. Or create a Personal Access Token in GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings

### Large File Warnings
If you get warnings about large files:
- This is normal for repositories with many text files
- Consider using Git LFS if files are very large

### Permission Denied
If you get permission denied:
- Make sure you're the owner of the repository
- Check that your GitHub username is correct in the URL

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup

1. **Create Issues**: Document future enhancements
2. **Add Collaborators**: Invite others to contribute
3. **Set up CI/CD**: Automate validation with GitHub Actions
4. **Documentation Website**: Use GitHub Pages for better presentation
5. **Community**: Add CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
