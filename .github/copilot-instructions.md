# AI Prompt Library - Copilot Instructions

This is an AI prompt library project focused on organizing and curating high-quality prompts for various AI models and use cases.

## Project Context

- **Purpose**: Create a comprehensive, well-organized collection of AI prompts
- **Structure**: Organized by categories (creative, technical, general, agentic, professional)
- **Prompt Types**: Each category contains system prompts, developer prompts, and user prompts
- **Format**: Markdown files with consistent formatting and metadata

## Code Generation Guidelines

When generating code for this project:

1. **Prompt Format**: Follow the established markdown format with clear headers, metadata, and examples
2. **Categories**: Maintain the five main categories and three prompt types per category
3. **Quality**: Focus on creating practical, tested, and well-documented prompts
4. **Consistency**: Use consistent formatting across all prompt files
5. **Documentation**: Include clear usage examples and expected outcomes

## File Organization

- `src/prompts/[category]/system-prompts.md`: AI system configuration prompts
- `src/prompts/[category]/developer-prompts.md`: Development and coding prompts  
- `src/prompts/[category]/user-prompts.md`: End-user interaction prompts
- `docs/`: Documentation and guidelines
- `examples/`: Sample implementations and use cases

## Best Practices

- Test all prompts before including them
- Provide clear context and usage instructions
- Include expected AI model compatibility
- Use semantic versioning for major prompt updates
- Follow markdown best practices for readability
