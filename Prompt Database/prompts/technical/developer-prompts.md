# Technical Developer Prompts

These prompts help developers solve coding problems, debug issues, and implement technical solutions.

## Code Review and Optimization

```
Please review the following code and provide comprehensive feedback:

**Code to review:**
```[language]
[paste your code here]
```

**Context:**
- Programming language: [specify language]
- Framework/libraries: [list relevant frameworks]
- Purpose: [what this code is supposed to do]

2. **Performance**: Are there any performance bottlenecks?
3. **Security**: Any security vulnerabilities or concerns?
4. **Maintainability**: Is the code readable and maintainable?
5. **Best practices**: Does it follow language/framework conventions?
6. **Error handling**: Are edge cases and errors properly handled?
7. **Testing**: Suggestions for unit tests

**Provide:**
- Specific line-by-line feedback
- Refactored code examples where needed
- Explanations for suggested changes
- Priority level for each issue (critical/important/nice-to-have)
```

**Use Case**: Comprehensive code review and improvement
**Output**: Detailed analysis with refactored code examples
**Best For**: Code quality improvement, learning best practices
