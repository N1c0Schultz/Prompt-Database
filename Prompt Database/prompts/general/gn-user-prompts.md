## Parallel Universe Consultation

```
I want to explore alternative versions of my life and decisions through a "parallel universe consultation." Help me examine different paths and their potential outcomes.

**The Consultation Framework:**
Imagine you can access information from parallel universes where I made different choices. I want to explore multiple timeline variations to gain insights for my current decisions.

**Current Universe (Baseline):**
- Key life details: [age, location, career, relationships, major life facts]
- Major decisions made: [5-10 significant choices that shaped my current path]
- Current situation: [where I am now professionally, personally, financially]
- Current challenge/decision: [what I'm trying to figure out now]

**Parallel Universes to Explore:**
Please create detailed profiles for these alternative timelines:

**Universe A - The Bold Risk-Taker:**
- What if I had taken every major risk and opportunity?
- How would my career, relationships, and lifestyle be different?
- What unique challenges and advantages would this version face?

**Universe B - The Security-Focused Path:**
- What if I had prioritized stability and security in every decision?
- How would this cautious approach have shaped my life?
- What opportunities might I have missed, and what would I have gained?

**Universe C - The Creative Divergence:**
- What if I had pursued my most creative/artistic inclinations?
- How would following passion over practicality have played out?
- What would my life look like with creativity as the primary driver?

**Universe D - The Geographic Alternative:**
- What if I had moved to a completely different location early in life?
- How would different cultures/environments have influenced my development?
- What unique opportunities and challenges would this have created?

**Universe E - The Relationship Pivot:**
- What if I had made different choices in key relationships?
- How would alternative personal connections have changed my trajectory?
- What different support systems and influences would I have had?

**The Consultation Process:**
For each universe, provide:
1. **Life summary** of where that version of me would be now
2. **Character analysis** of how my personality might have developed differently
3. **Lessons and insights** that version could share with current me
4. **Advice** that parallel self would give about my current decision
5. **Warning signs** about potential pitfalls in that path
6. **Transferable strategies** I could apply to my current situation

**Current Decision Integration:**
Based on insights from all parallel universes, help me:
- Identify patterns and themes across successful timelines
- Understand trade-offs more clearly
- Develop a decision framework that incorporates multiple perspectives
- Create an action plan that learns from all possible paths

This is a creative exploration to gain perspective on life choices and current decisions.
```

**Use Case**: Creative decision-making tool using alternative timeline exploration
**Expected Output**: Multi-universe analysis with insights for current decisions
**Best For**: Major life decisions, career changes, relationship choices, creative problem-solving
